## Hackathon

At the end of the Hackathon on Friday, August 7, we will have a block for presentations of work done on these topics. Forming groups is strongly encouraged!

Enter your team here by 10am on Friday, August 7: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSet8dT2C8BQ4-VUxBxkaFu3qnl1PfUEychhENRS1Gn-1wiJcA/viewform

### Prompts

1. From Miles and Jose (New prompt as of Aug 5): Equation Hunting in Gaia. The data is a table of Gaia DR3 stars with full 6D phase-space coordinates (positions, proper motions, radial velocities, and propagated uncertainties) https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8088365 . A snapshot of a collisionless system already contains its dynamics: in equilibrium the collisionless Boltzmann equation relates the phase-space density f(x,v), which the stars sample directly, to the Galactic potential Φ(x), which nobody can measure, stellar accelerations here are of order 1 cm/s/yr. Your task is using the template-and-derivative machinery from the tutorial, plus any preprocessing you like, search jointly for a closed-form f and Φ that kill this residual while f still describes the stars you were given. Scoring combines held-out accuracy, residual size, and the complexity of both expressions. There is no ground truth, the potential of the Galaxy is genuinely unknown, and nobody knows the best achievable score. Existing work represents Φ with a neural network, so a compact symbolic form that scores competitively would be new, and a good enough equation could lead to a paper. Hold out your own test split to verify anything you find.

3. From Jun-Yan and Mathis: The tutorial's spiral has a swirl strength that stays fixed throughout. Vary it, and train a single model that takes that strength as an input, so one network covers the whole family of targets. Sweep the knob and render the density morphing; then set it outside the range you trained on and check the samples against the true density. Optionally apply this idea to a family of conjugation equivariant targets on SU(3), with a trained CNF.
4. From Jun-Yan and Mathis: Train a velocity field that transports one distribution straight into another — a ring of blobs into a spiral, or two shapes you invent — and render the deformation. Then ask what makes a good pairing between the two ends, and what happens when you chain three shapes in a loop.
5. From Berthy, Franc, and Aneel: Extend InverseBench (https://github.com/devzhk/InverseBench) with a scientific inverse problem of your choice. Implement the physics-based forward model and benchmark the available diffusion-model-based sampling algorithms included in InverseBench. Optionally, extend InverseBench with a new diffusion-model-based sampling algorithm or one based on a recent paper
6. From Berthy, Franc, and Aneel: Develop a diffusion-model-based approach for solving a blind inverse imaging problem, i.e., one where the forward model is unknown. In blind inverse problems, typically the setup is that certain parameters of the forward model are unknown, and they are fit with a learned prior along with the unknown image. See https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25269 for an example of a diffusion-model-based approach to a blind inverse problem in ptychography.
7. From Christoph and Christina: Stellar streams are among the best dynamical probes we have of the Milky Way's gravitational potential and its dark matter. A globular cluster or dwarf galaxy caught in the Galactic tide slowly unravels into a thin ribbon of stars strung along its orbit, and the ribbon's length, width, and kinematics encode both the progenitor that made it and the potential it fell through. The forward model is a stochastic, multi-Gyr disruption simulation with no tractable likelihood. Use simulation-based inference to estimate the GD1 progenitor's parameters from a binned image of its stream, marginalize the eight stripping nuisances, and check whether the posteriors are actually calibrated.
